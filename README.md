# HackNC

## We wanted an app that would easily connect us with fellow students with the same courses we are currently taking and find students who are closest to us.

## The app takes in user input of subjects that they want a study partner(s), and it matches the user with other users with similar cources and who are in the closes proximity. The app also enables for chatting between study partner(s).

## We used the platform Thunkable to design our app. We were ablel to make use of the many components offered by Thunkable, such as location sensor, realtime data base powered by firebase, and block coding.

## We found that we were limited by what we could do using block coding, and being beginners, it took us considerable amount of time to understand and implement some of the features

## We are proud of embarking on this journey of creating an app, and collaborating with each other to make an app that will be useful to many students.

## We learned how a realtime data base works, and how to add and retireve data from said data base. We were also able to learn how block coding works and how to implement it in our app

## We plan to finish our app with all the components we visioned to be present. We also plan to fine tune it and make it more appleaning to the users.
